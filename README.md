# CSC220Assignment6

I compiled my project using the IDE IntelliJ.

It is a java program with methods for doing running a self-serve gas station simulation.

This was very difficult due to the lack of instructions. Half the time, I didn't get the point of some methods.
I had to ask for help and work with others to get it done. I hope James Wong gets some feedback on why this kind of project
isn't ok.
